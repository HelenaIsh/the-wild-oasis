# The Wild Oasis – React + Vite + react-router

This is a full-featured React application built with a modern tech stack, focusing on efficient data fetching, state management, and UI styling. It integrates Supabase for backend services, React Query for server-state management, and styled-components for CSS-in-JS styling.

1. Real-time data handling with Supabase and React Query (TanStack Query).
2. Form management via react-hook-form with validation.
3. Error resilience using react-error-boundary.
4. Visualizations powered by Recharts.
5. UI/UX polish with react-hot-toast notifications and styled-components.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
